# About Me

I design and build scalable, maintainable, and performant applications across cloud platforms. Experienced in both frontend and backend ecosystems, I focus on delivering reliable, secure, and user‑friendly solutions using modern frameworks and best practices.

Recently, I’ve expanded into AI technologies, running local models, integrating with LLM providers, and developing custom AI training pipelines beyond LLMs.
